The Support group can be reached out to at [MetaButler](https://t.me/MetaButler), where you can ask for help setting up your bot, discover/request new features, report bugs, and stay in the loop whenever a new update is available.

## Setting up the bot (Read this before trying to use!):

# How to setup

- `clone this repository`

- `cd MetaButler`

- `cp sample_config.ini config.ini`

- *Fill in all the vars*

- `pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt`

*Enjoy!*

# How can I obtain `bot_token`?

Just talk to [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)(described [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather))

and follow a few simple steps. Once you've created a bot and received your

authorization token, that's it! that's your `bot_token`.

# How can I obtain a `api_key` and `api_hash`?

In order to obtain an API key and hash you need to do the following:

 - Sign up for Telegram using any application.

 - Login to your Telegram core: [https://my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).

 - Go to '[API Development tools](https://my.telegram.org/apps)' and fill out the form.

 - You will get basic addresses as well as the `api_id` and `api_hash` parameters

   required for Metabutler's configuration file.
